00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,925
Hey everyone, it's me Jared.

2
00:00:01,925 --> 00:00:03,340
And I'd like to show you the App we're going to

3
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,735
create in this course called Pitch Perfect.

4
00:00:05,735 --> 00:00:08,130
Pitch Perfect allows you to record your voice and

5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,225
play it back with various sound effects,

6
00:00:10,225 --> 00:00:11,750
including changes to speed,

7
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,080
pitch and even reverb an echo.

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,535
I'm running it here in the iOS simulator so that I can show you.

9
00:00:17,535 --> 00:00:20,595
The first screen simply prompts you to record your voice.

10
00:00:20,595 --> 00:00:25,410
Here at Udacity we believe that asking questions is one of the best ways to learn.

11
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:30,830
Judge a man by his questions rather than by his answers.

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,080
Now, you can see that Pitch Perfect has moved this to the Playback View,

13
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,820
we can choose to playback my voice using a variety of different sound effects.

14
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,995
Let's try listening to my voice played back really fast.

15
00:00:44,995 --> 00:00:49,010
"Judge a man by his questions rather than by his answers."

16
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:54,870
Or we can playback my voice at a really low pitch and I'll sound like Darth Vader.

17
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,100
"Judge a man by his questions rather than by his answers."

18
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,810
This app is a lot of fun to play with,

19
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,310
but more importantly as you build this app you'll learn

20
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,950
key iOS development concepts along the way.
