Welcome to iOS development I'm Jerry,

2
00:00:03,094 --> 00:00:05,219
content developer here at Udacity.

3
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:07,090
In this course we're going to build an app that lets you

4
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,950
record your voice and play it back with sound effects.

5
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:14,850
But first, this course assumes you're familiar with some basic programming concepts.

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,030
You don't need to have written

7
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:19,585
any iOS apps but you should be comfortable with writing IF statements,

8
00:00:19,585 --> 00:00:22,020
loops and classes in Swift.

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,455
We'll build on that foundation to show you how to write your first app.

10
00:00:25,455 --> 00:00:28,000
Let's start by looking at the steps we'll take to build it.
