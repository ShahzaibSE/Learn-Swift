1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,415
In this class, we'll build an app called Pitch Perfect,

2
00:00:03,415 --> 00:00:07,600
which lets you record your voice and play it back with changes to pitch.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,430
To do this, we'll explore and get comfortable with

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,800
Xcode, Apple's development environment.

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,110
You can use Xcode to create apps for any of

6
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:17,140
Apple's platforms from the Watch to Apple TV to iOS,

7
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,710
and even the Mac.

8
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,590
This lesson, Introduction and Xcode,

9
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,705
is about getting comfortable with Xcode.

10
00:00:22,705 --> 00:00:24,335
In Audio Layouts and Buttons,

11
00:00:24,335 --> 00:00:28,125
we'll set up the initial screen of the app for the user to record their own voice.

12
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:29,965
We'll learn how to lay out the user interface,

13
00:00:29,965 --> 00:00:33,370
how to connect UI elements such as our buttons to code.

14
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,355
In ViewController and Multiple Views,

15
00:00:35,355 --> 00:00:37,840
we're going to step it up a notch by adding a second screen

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,900
to the app where the user can apply audio effects.

17
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,490
Next, in Delegation and Recording,

18
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:46,816
we'll explore how to pass the recorded audio from the first screen to the second.

19
00:00:46,816 --> 00:00:48,370
Then in Playback and Audio Effects,

20
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:52,360
we'll add the functionality for adding various alterations to the pitch.

21
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,560
As you progress through course,

22
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,380
you'll be practicing fundamental iOS concepts that you can

23
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,000
apply for any app that you build. Let's get started.
